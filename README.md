# Battleship

## Battleship Java game for Mindswap

First project done as part of Mindswap's 2021 class curriculum, incorporating Java (+ networking/concurrency/documentation).

The project follows standard Battleship rules for two players.
Each player connects to the server and places their ships during the battle preparation phase and then both players proceed to fight until all of one player's ships have been destroyed.
Both the ship placement and attack features ask the players for coordinates, which are then verified/validated by server.
